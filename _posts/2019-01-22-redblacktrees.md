Zillow aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of property tax assessments. Property tax records need to be managed and updated regularly based on various factors such as property value, location, and recent sales data. By using Red-Black Trees, Zillow can maintain a balanced and sorted collection of property tax records, ensuring fast and efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. This approach allows Zillow to handle large datasets of property assessments effectively, leading to more accurate and timely tax assessments.

### Perks of using red-black trees for managing tax records
- Red-Black Trees maintain a balanced structure, ensuring that the tree's height is logarithmic relative to the number of nodes. This guarantees efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and lookup.
- With logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, Red-Black Trees allow for quick access to property assessment records, even as the dataset grows.
- Red-Black Trees handle large datasets effectively, making them suitable for managing Zillow's extensive database of property tax records.

## Implementation
- Create a Red-Black Tree where each node represents a property.
- Each node should contain the property ID as the key and assessment details as the value.
- Implement a function to insert new property assessments into the Red-Black Tree.
- Ensure the tree remains balanced after each insertion by following the Red-Black Tree properties.
- Implement a function to update existing property assessments in the Red-Black Tree.
- Locate the node based on the property ID and update the assessment details.
- Implement a function to search for a property assessment based on the property ID.
- Use the Red-Black Tree's balanced structure to perform efficient lookups.
