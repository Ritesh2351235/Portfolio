Zillow aims to optimize the property reservation system to prevent double-booking and ensure that users can easily find available properties within their desired time frames. By implementing an Interval Tree, Zillow can efficiently manage and query overlapping time intervals, providing a robust solution for managing property availability.

### Perks of using Interval Tree

- **Prevent Double-Booking:** Efficiently manage overlapping reservations to avoid conflicts.
- **Improve User Experience:** Quickly find available properties within desired time frames.
- **Scalable Solution:** Handle increasing numbers of reservations without degrading performance.

## Implementation Steps
   - Implement an Interval Tree where each node represents a property reservation with a start and end time. Each node should also store the maximum end time of any interval in its subtree to facilitate efficient overlap queries.

   - Create a function to insert new property reservations into the Interval Tree. This function will ensure that the tree remains balanced and updates the maximum end time values appropriately.

   - Develop a function to search the Interval Tree for overlapping reservations given a new reservation request. This function will quickly identify any existing reservations that conflict with the requested time frame.

   - Implement functions to update existing reservations, including modifying the start or end times. Ensure that any changes trigger the necessary rebalancing and maximum end time updates to maintain the treeâ€™s efficiency.

   - Create a function to delete reservations from the Interval Tree. This function should also handle rebalancing and update the maximum end time values in the affected subtrees.
