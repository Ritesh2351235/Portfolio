<h2 class="font-weight-bold spanborder"><span>My Learnings</span></h2>
<p class="custom-font-content my-4" style="font-size: 18px">
    Through this Portfolio i have learned many things including the design intution on how the real world applications
    are designed with the help of datastructures and algorithms.
    I have explored a wide range of data structures and algorithms such as B trees , segment trees,lazy
    propogation,dynamic programming and many more. By analyzing their performance characteristics and suitability, I
    have been able to apply these concepts effectively to real business cases from Zillow.
    This Portfolio gave me an idea on how the things really work in real applications and how they are designed and
    efficient accessible for the users.
